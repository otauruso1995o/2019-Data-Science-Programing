My name is Dobie and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on October 3, 2018 because they were unable to care for me any longer. I lived in a home with adults only. My previous owner described me as shy, playful, demanding, and protective.<p/><p/>My caregivers soon realized that I did not thrive in a shelter environment so I was sent to an amazing foster home so they could get to know me a little better.<p/><p/>I am in a foster home with three large dogs. I immediately melded with the household dogs extremely well. I like to play and I seem to do well with large dogs. I love playing with other large dogs so much that I will regularly jumped the fence between my yard and the neighbor's yard so I can play with the dog over there as well! When I am not playing with my dog friend's, I love to snooze with them in a big puppy pile.<p/><p/>My foster has found that I bond quickly and I warm up to my humans easily. Once I know you and trust you, I am great with body handling and grooming. I am also super affectionate and loving. I do have some ""stranger danger"" though which results in sometimes barking at neighbors in their yard. I have been to stores and walks though where I notice strangers but do not bark at them. The scariest place for me seems to be the vet.<p/><p/>I am a fun dog that loves to play fetch, tug, tear up toys, and solve food puzzles. I am perfectly housetrained at my foster's home. My previous owner said that I may have some separation anxiety when home alone but my foster has discovered that I am just wicked smart and can open doors and gates and then will have some destructive habits due to boredom. I do best when put in a dog proof room with another dog. Because I am super smart and am very food motivated, I am also super easy to train!<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/><p/>Dobie is currently in a foster home with one of our volunteers, Amanda R.

When I was a wee little one, I was not taught how nice and friendly people can be, but I am learning quickly! Though I may be timid at first, once you take the time to show me I can trust you I will show you just how wonderful I can be. I would love to go home with a confident kitty friend who can help me come out of my shell!<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/><p/>",BLUE

I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy. I very much enjoy playing with a ball and will let you know when I want to play. <p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I don't do well with other dogs. I would thrive in a home as the only pet.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",RED

When I was a wee little one, I was not taught how nice and friendly people can be, but I am learning quickly! Though I may be timid at first, once you take the time to show me I can trust you I will show you just how wonderful I can be. I would love to go home with a confident kitty friend who can help me come out of my shell!<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/><p/>",BLUE
